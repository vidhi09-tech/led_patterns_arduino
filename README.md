# led_patterns_arduino

As an electronic student, arduino plays a key role in their lives..
Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software.
It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.
The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino programming language and Arduino Development Environment.

I have write the program for 5 led patterns and even uploaded the circuit diagram with the output.. It will make others easy to understand the program..
